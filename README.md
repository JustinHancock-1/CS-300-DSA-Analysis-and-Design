# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Leding up to our first project, we learned about calculating the run time of a program to find the most efficient way to sort through a list. The final project required us to decide a strategy to sort a list of courses in alphneumeric order to print for the user. We were also required to set up a search feature that would find the course and show all of the prerquisites for that particular course.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Throughout the weeks, we learned about vector sorting, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees. I found the most comfort in the binary search trees. After taking discrete mathematics last term, I understand how a binary search tree works very well, and I found it fairly easy to design a program around that.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I did come across a few roadblocks for these two projects, but I just tried to keep my pseudocode for the first project clean and simple. When completing the second project, I did have to change some things from my original psuedocode, but I like to keep the pseudocode vague to give some freedom when actually creating the program.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The work throughout this course has better prepared me to create high functioning, fast programs to read and organize information from a file to then print out and present to the user. I will definitely be using the information that I have learned in future positions.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think that all the courses I have taken so far have done a great job teaching me how to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. I know that I am still a beginner, and I have a lot to learn, but I feel like I am off to a good start with the basics.
